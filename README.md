These python jupyter notebooks are created to help replicate results for the article titled "A Hundred Years of Racial Discourse in Urban Studies."  
Specifically, I packaged codes for different sections and functionalities separately for easier revisions:  
Race_in_Urban_Studies_LDA.ipynb corresponds to the LDA topic modeling
Race_in_Urban_Studies_W2V.ipynb corresponds to the Word2Vector semantic analylsis  
Race_in_Urban_Studies_CosineSim.ipynb corresponds to the cosine similarity analysis across decades 
Race_in_Urban_Studies_HateSpeech.ipynb corresponds to the probablity of hate speech analysis 
Becasue the data for analysis (abstracts of Urban Studies Literature) are not publicly available data and require subscriptions to literature databases, I removed the specific link to data files in the above codes.
However, researchers who have subscriptions to these databases (through their institutions for example) can follow the specified steps in the article to download the appropriate abstracts and orgainize them into decades, and by disciplines, and use the above codes to replicate the results. 
Codes for disciplinary analysis are not separately provided as they are essentially the same as Race_in_Urban_Studies_W2V.ipynb, Race_in_Urban_Studies_CosineSim.ipynb, and Race_in_Urban_Studies_HateSpeech.ipynb with just the file links changing to discipline-speicifc, decade-specific files.
